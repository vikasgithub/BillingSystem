Project Structure
-------------------
This Intellij idea based project contains two source folders. This project can be easily imported into eclipse
as I have generated the eclipse compatible .classpath and .project files.
1. src - contains the main classes
2. test - contains the test cases.

Package Structure
-----------------
1. com.mckinsey.exercise.domain - This package contains the main domain classes and Enums.
2. com.mckinsey.exercise.rules - This package contains the business rules and discount classes.
3. com.mckinsey.exercise.service - This package contains the services. There are two main services
